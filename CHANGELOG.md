## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-07 — Resource Chains & Processing Buildings (Game Richness Phase 1)

Transforms the flat 2-resource economy into a layered processing chain with 5 new buildings, 5 new resources, and 5 new worker roles. Inspired by RimWorld's resource depth.

### New Tile Types

| Tile | ID | Build Cost | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| QUARRY | 8 | wood: 6 | Workers gather stone (primary resource) |
| HERB_GARDEN | 9 | wood: 4 | Workers gather herbs (primary resource) |
| KITCHEN | 10 | wood: 8, stone: 3 | Converts 2 food → 1 meal (3s cycle, requires COOK) |
| SMITHY | 11 | wood: 6, stone: 8 | Converts 3 stone + 2 wood → 1 tool (8s cycle, requires SMITH) |
| CLINIC | 12 | wood: 6, herbs: 4 | Converts 2 herbs → 1 medicine (4s cycle, requires HERBALIST) |

### New Resources

- **Stone** — Primary resource gathered at quarries, used for smithy/kitchen/tower construction
- **Herbs** — Primary resource gathered at herb gardens, used for clinic construction and medicine
- **Meals** — Processed good (kitchen output), 2x hunger recovery vs raw food
- **Tools** — Processed good (smithy output), +15% harvest speed per tool (cap 3, max +45%)
- **Medicine** — Processed good (clinic output), heals most injured worker at 8 HP/s

### New Worker Roles

| Role | Intent | Target | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| STONE | quarry | QUARRY | Gathers stone like FARM gathers food |
| HERBS | gather_herbs | HERB_GARDEN | Gathers herbs like FARM gathers food |
| COOK | cook | KITCHEN | Stands at kitchen to process food → meals |
| SMITH | smith | SMITHY | Stands at smithy to process stone+wood → tools |
| HERBALIST | heal | CLINIC | Stands at clinic to process herbs → medicine |

### Systems

- **ProcessingSystem** (NEW) — Per-building cooldown timers, worker adjacency check (Manhattan distance ≤ 1), input/output resource management. Inserted into SYSTEM_ORDER after ResourceSystem.
- **RoleAssignmentSystem** — Extended from 2-role to 7-role allocation. Specialists capped at 1 per building type. Building-availability gating (no quarry → no STONE workers).
- **ResourceSystem** — Calculates tool production multiplier, clamps all 7 resources, NaN reset.
- **MortalitySystem** — Medicine healing: finds most injured worker, heals at 8 HP/s, consumes 0.1 medicine/s.
- **WorkerAISystem** — 5 new intents, stone/herbs harvesting and delivery, meal consumption preference, tool multiplier applied to all harvest rates.

### Rendering

- 5 procedural tile textures (quarry: stone rubble, herb_garden: herb dots, kitchen: hearth grid, smithy: cross-hatch, clinic: medical cross)
- Instanced mesh rendering with tint/roughness/emissive profiles

### Build System

- Multi-resource costs (stone, herbs) for kitchen/smithy/clinic
- Salvage refund for all new tiles (50% of each resource cost)
- Quarry/herb garden blobs in procedural map generation

### AI

- Extended worker intent contract with 5 new intents
- Fallback policy boosts: quarry when stone < 15, gather_herbs when herbs < 10, cook when food > 30
- World summary includes all 7 resource types

### Benchmarks

- 4 new presets: `resource_chains_basic`, `full_processing`, `scarce_advanced`, `tooled_colony`
- Updated `developed_colony` preset with processing buildings
- Fixed `cloneWorker` carry format to include stone/herbs
- Generalized `applyPreset` resource handling

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-07 — AI Architecture Reform (Phase 1-3)

Research-driven reform of the LLM agent system, implementing hierarchical architecture with memory and benchmarking infrastructure.

### Research & Analysis

- **Architecture analysis** — Identified 7 critical problems in current AI system vs SOTA, referencing 20+ papers from UIST/NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR/AAAI/ACL 2023-2026
- **Benchmark design** — 20+ quantifiable metrics with composite scoring (T_composite), automated evaluation pipeline
- **Reform proposal** — Hierarchical agent architecture (Strategic Director -> Tactical Planner -> Executors) with memory stream, CoT reasoning, spatial task graphs

### Benchmark Infrastructure (Phase 1)

- **BenchmarkMetrics module** — Task composite score (T_surv, T_obj, T_res, T_pop, T_pros, T_threat), cost metrics (C_tok, C_min, C_lat, C_fb), decision quality metrics
- **Benchmark runner** — Automated headless runner: 3 scenarios x 2 conditions x N seeds, CLI flags for smoke testing, JSON + markdown output
- **Baseline results** — 60 runs establishing deterministic baseline (T_composite ~0.606-0.614)

### Memory Stream (Phase 2)

- **MemoryStore** — Observation stream with keyword-based retrieval, recency x relevance x importance scoring (inspired by Generative Agents, Park et al. 2023)
- **Game event recording** — Deaths, food-critical, objective completion, weather changes automatically recorded as observations

### Hierarchical Architecture (Phase 3)

- **StrategicDirector** — New top-level system with CoT reasoning prompt, deterministic fallback strategy, async LLM pattern
- **DecisionScheduler** — Event-driven + heartbeat trigger system replacing fixed intervals; critical events (workers=0, food<=5, threat>=85) trigger immediate decisions
- **Prompt engineering** — Strategic director prompt with ReAct-style reasoning (Observe -> Reflect -> Plan -> Act)
- **Full integration** — StrategicDirector and MemoryStore wired into GameApp, soak-sim, benchmark runner, and prompt pipeline

Visual transformation from developer-tool aesthetics to game-like interface.

### HUD & Viewport

- **Icon-rich resource bar** — Replaced plain-text status bar with dark-themed HUD featuring pixel-art icons (Apple, Wood Log, Gear, Golden Coin, Skull), colored progress bars, and low-resource urgency highlights (`f4dae4a`)
- **Build tool icons** — Added pixel-art icons to all 6 build buttons (Road, Farm, Lumber, Warehouse, Wall, Erase) (`29f6382`)
- **In-viewport speed controls** — Added pause/play/2x speed buttons and mm:ss game timer at bottom-center of viewport (`046394f`)
- **Dark Entity Focus panel** — Restyled entity inspector with dark translucent background matching the HUD theme (`de854da`)
- **Dark layout controls** — "☰ Menu" / "Debug" buttons with dark game-style appearance (`8fe9e28`)

### Start & End Screens

- **Objective cards** — Replaced monospace `<pre>` objectives dump with styled numbered cards showing current/next status (`265e680`)
- **Gradient title** — "Project Utopia" with blue gradient text, scenario badge, keyboard controls hint bar
- **Game-style buttons** — "Start Colony" / "New Map" / "Try Again" with prominent primary styling
- **Victory/Defeat display** — End screen shows green "Victory!" or red "Colony Lost" gradient, time as mm:ss

### Sidebar Cleanup

- **"Colony Manager" heading** — Replaced "Project Utopia" developer-facing header (`8fe9e28`)
- **Hidden dev clutter** — Compact Mode checkbox, Visual Mode legend, developer description text all hidden via CSS
- **Page title** — Changed from "Project Utopia - Beta Build" to "Project Utopia"

### Files Changed

- `index.html` — Status bar, build buttons, speed controls, overlay, entity focus, layout controls (CSS + HTML)
- `src/ui/hud/HUDController.js` — Icon HUD rendering, progress bars, urgency cues, speed control wiring, game timer

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-07 — Game Playability Overhaul

Major architecture-level rework to transform the colony simulation from an unplayable prototype (dying in ~13 seconds) into a stable, guided gameplay loop.

### Balance & Survival Fixes

- **Visitor ratio rebalanced** — Trader/saboteur split changed from 80/20 to 50/50; saboteur initial cooldown raised from 8-14s to 25-40s, recurring cooldown from 7-13s to 18-30s (`4268998`)
- **Grace period added** — New 90-second early-game window during which prosperity/threat loss condition cannot trigger; immediate loss on workers=0 or resources=0 preserved (`35d0c17`)
- **Pressure multipliers reduced ~60%** — Weather, event, and contested-zone multipliers for both prosperity and threat cut to prevent single-event collapse spirals (`b11083e`)
- **Starting infrastructure expanded** — Scenario now stamps 4 farms (+2), 2 lumber mills (+1), 7 defensive walls (+4); starting food raised to 80, removed alpha resource cap (`634160b`)
- **Initial population reduced** — Workers 18→12, visitors 6→4, herbivores 5→3, predators stays 1; reduces early resource drain to match infrastructure capacity (`7d90bb8`)

### UI & Onboarding Improvements

- **Developer dock hidden by default** — Telemetry panels no longer visible on first launch; toggle button reads "Show Dev Dock" (`65c6b17`)
- **Non-essential panels collapsed** — Stress Test, AI Insights, AI Exchange panels start collapsed; only Build Tool and Management remain open (`989e720`)
- **Start screen redesigned** — Title changed to "Colony Simulation" with 3 actionable quick-start tips; removed technical dump (scenario internals, pressure values, AI trace) (`71e3e76`)
- **Persistent status bar added** — Top bar shows Food, Wood, Workers, Prosperity, Threat, current objective, and color-coded action hints in real time (`c117c52`)
- **Build action feedback** — Status bar shows contextual messages when player builds structures (e.g., "Farm placed — food production will increase") (`fbf3ac1`)

### Tests

- Added 15 balance playability tests covering trader ratios, cooldown ranges, grace period, pressure bounds, starting resources, infrastructure counts, population limits, and a 60-second unattended survival integration test (`41b196a`)
- Fixed existing test regressions in `run-outcome`, `alpha-scenario`, and `wildlife-population-system` tests

### Verification

Playtest results (unattended, no player input):

| Metric | Before | After (3s) | After (45s) | After (95s) |
|--------|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Food | ~55 | 74 | 44 | 19 |
| Wood | ~70 | 64 | 48 | 31 |
| Workers | 18 | 12 | 12 | 12 |
| Prosperity | 5.3 → loss | 40 | 19 | 26 (recovering) |
| Threat | 93.7 → loss | 51 | 72 | 57 (declining) |
| Outcome | Dead at 13s | Alive | Alive | Alive & stabilizing |
