## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-07 — Game Playability Overhaul

Major architecture-level rework to transform the colony simulation from an unplayable prototype (dying in ~13 seconds) into a stable, guided gameplay loop.

### Balance & Survival Fixes

- **Visitor ratio rebalanced** — Trader/saboteur split changed from 80/20 to 50/50; saboteur initial cooldown raised from 8-14s to 25-40s, recurring cooldown from 7-13s to 18-30s (`4268998`)
- **Grace period added** — New 90-second early-game window during which prosperity/threat loss condition cannot trigger; immediate loss on workers=0 or resources=0 preserved (`35d0c17`)
- **Pressure multipliers reduced ~60%** — Weather, event, and contested-zone multipliers for both prosperity and threat cut to prevent single-event collapse spirals (`b11083e`)
- **Starting infrastructure expanded** — Scenario now stamps 4 farms (+2), 2 lumber mills (+1), 7 defensive walls (+4); starting food raised to 80, removed alpha resource cap (`634160b`)
- **Initial population reduced** — Workers 18→12, visitors 6→4, herbivores 5→3, predators stays 1; reduces early resource drain to match infrastructure capacity (`7d90bb8`)

### UI & Onboarding Improvements

- **Developer dock hidden by default** — Telemetry panels no longer visible on first launch; toggle button reads "Show Dev Dock" (`65c6b17`)
- **Non-essential panels collapsed** — Stress Test, AI Insights, AI Exchange panels start collapsed; only Build Tool and Management remain open (`989e720`)
- **Start screen redesigned** — Title changed to "Colony Simulation" with 3 actionable quick-start tips; removed technical dump (scenario internals, pressure values, AI trace) (`71e3e76`)
- **Persistent status bar added** — Top bar shows Food, Wood, Workers, Prosperity, Threat, current objective, and color-coded action hints in real time (`c117c52`)
- **Build action feedback** — Status bar shows contextual messages when player builds structures (e.g., "Farm placed — food production will increase") (`fbf3ac1`)

### Tests

- Added 15 balance playability tests covering trader ratios, cooldown ranges, grace period, pressure bounds, starting resources, infrastructure counts, population limits, and a 60-second unattended survival integration test (`41b196a`)
- Fixed existing test regressions in `run-outcome`, `alpha-scenario`, and `wildlife-population-system` tests

### Verification

Playtest results (unattended, no player input):

| Metric | Before | After (3s) | After (45s) | After (95s) |
|--------|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Food | ~55 | 74 | 44 | 19 |
| Wood | ~70 | 64 | 48 | 31 |
| Workers | 18 | 12 | 12 | 12 |
| Prosperity | 5.3 → loss | 40 | 19 | 26 (recovering) |
| Threat | 93.7 → loss | 51 | 72 | 57 (declining) |
| Outcome | Dead at 13s | Alive | Alive | Alive & stabilizing |
